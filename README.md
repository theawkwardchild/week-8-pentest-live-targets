# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL injection

Vulnerability #2: Session hijacking ![ ](https://github.com/theawkwardchild/week-8-pentest-live-targets/blob/master/week%208%20blue%20session.gif)


## Green

Vulnerability #2: User enumeration ![ ](https://github.com/theawkwardchild/week-8-pentest-live-targets/blob/master/week%208%20green%20user%20enum.gif)


## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure object reference ![ ](https://github.com/theawkwardchild/week-8-pentest-live-targets/blob/master/week%208%20red%20idor.gif)

Vulnerability #2: CSRF

## Notes

No real challenges this week I found the vulnerabilities pretty easy to find and exploit. For the SQL injection I found it quickly but was unable to get much of a response with manual testing, SQLmap did the job well though.
